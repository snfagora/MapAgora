# Summary

Nonprofit organizations are vital in understanding civic activities and their economic, political, and social causes and consequences in the U.S. Despite their importance, it is difficult to analyze their characteristics systematically at a large scale because information about these organizations is scattered across different sources, such as their tax reports, websites, and social media posts. The related challenge is the information in these data sources is stored in diverse, unstructured formats such as XML (Extensible Markup Language), HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

**MapAgora** addresses all of these problems. It helps researchers and practitioners systematically collect information on nonprofit organizations in the U.S. based on nonprofit organizations' tax reports, websites, and social media posts with little technical understanding of the underlying unstructured data formats. The package enables collecting the basic information on nonprofit organizations based on the tax reports these organizations annually filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (called IRS 990 filings). It also helps to extract how these organizations describe themselves based on their websites and social media posts. The physical locations of these organizations can be easily linked with the other administrative data such as the Census, and the rich text data can be used to classify these organizations using natural language processing and machine learning.

The package is available on GitHub and can be installed in the following way:

```{r}
# Install devtools 
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")

# Install MapAgora 
install_github("snfagora/MapAgora")
```

# Statement of need

**MapAgora** is an R package that helps researchers and practitioners to collect the most comprehensive data on nonprofit organizations in the U.S. [Nonprofit Open Data Collectieve](https://nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/) also provide open datasets and tools, which support research on the nonprofit sector. The [National Center for Charitable Statistics](https://nccs-data.urban.org/data.php?ds=bmf) at the Urban Institute shared their data archives on the IRS 990 filings. However, these open datasets and tools are limited to the IRS 990 filings. If researchers and practitioners are interested in linking these data with other digital traces, such as websites and social media posts, they need to deal with many technical challenges. `MapAgora` reduces these steps and offers a flexible tool that can fit into the various needs of researchers and practitioners.

**MapAgora** is designed for researchers and practitioners interested in systematically examining nonprofit organizations in the U.S. One application is creating  nonprofit datasets that can be used directly for analysis and linked with other administrative datasets such as the Census. The other application is classifying the nonprofit sector based on the text data collected from tax reports, websites, and social media posts [@ma2020automated].

# Package design 

**MapAgora** has been designed with several key principles in mind.

_Principle 1_. [Abstracted data gathering that unifies output while dealing with underlying complexity. (like 990 vs 990 EZ)]

_Principle 2_. [Unifiable data output. Data comes from different sources but can all be relationally linked between data sets.]

_Principle 3_. [Modularity. Get the bits of data you need from different data sets.]
