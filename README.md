# MapAgora

**MapAgora** is an R package that helps researchers and practitioners to collect the most comprehensive data on nonprofit organizations in the U.S. Nonprofit organizations are vital in understanding civic activities and their economic, political, and social causes and consequences in the U.S. Despite their importance, it is difficult to analyze their characteristics systematically at a large scale because information about these organizations is scattered across different sources, such as their tax reports, websites, and social media posts. **MapAgora** addresses all of these problems. It helps researchers and practitioners systematically collect information on nonprofit organizations in the U.S. based on nonprofit organizations' tax reports, websites, and social media posts with little technical understanding of the underlying unstructured data formats.

## Install the current development version from GitHub

The package is available on GitHub and can be installed in the following way:

```r

install_github("snfagora/MapAgora")
